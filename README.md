# Course Registration

## Description

Course Registration is a single-page website created with basic React and Tailwind CSS. This project allows users to add courses to their cart, and the selected course names will be displayed in the cart. Users cannot add the same course multiple times to their cart, and there is a constraint of not exceeding 20 hours of credits. The website is fully responsive across all devices, ensuring a seamless user experience. If a user attempts to select the same course multiple times or exceed the 20-hour credit limit, a toast notification will be displayed to alert them about the constraint.
